Ingredients:
	- 250g of brown Beans
	- 1 medium-sized Onion bulb
	- 3/2 cooking spoons of Palm-oil
	- 2 tablespoons ground Pepper
	- 2 teaspoons Salt
	- 3 table spoons of crayfish (optional)
	- An extra bowl of water

Directions:
	1. After picking the beans clean, proceed to rinse once in clean water. Drain and add beans into cooking pot. Fill pot with enough water.

	2. Chop and add onions (NOTE: Please do not add salt yet)

	3. Boil with medium heat for about an hour. Add extra water when you notice the water is drying up and the beans has not softened. (Alternatively, you may use pressure pots to hasten the cooking)

	NOTE: You may decide to cover the pot (especially if you are using pressure pot) or may partially cover the pot so as to prevent that water spilling over out from the pot.

	4. After beans has softened to your taste, with the boiling water just at the surface-level of the beans (i.e. not far below nor far above), add Palm-oil.

	5. Wait for one or two minutes, add salt and ground pepper. Then cover the pot and let it simmer for a few minutes.

	6. Open the pot and gently stir the contents very well. Then cover the pot again and let it cook well for some more minutes with low or medium heat.

	7. Taste and add more salt (or seasoning) if necesary then let it cook for few minutes.

	8. Turn-off when done and serve with fried plantain or bread or 'garri' (cassava cereal). Enjoy!
